# Lua Modules

If you want to load lua files on demand, you place them in the 
~/.config/nvim/lua directory.

You need to load the modules files from ~/.config/nvim/init.lua file for them 
to work, this is important and are not in the Neovim documentation.

In ~/.config/nvim/lua directory you can put as many modules you want, create a 
new directory for each module
